# Living QR Card

This repository hosts a single, minimal landing page used as the destination for a physical QR card.

The purpose is simple:
- test QR reliability on physical media
- observe real-world interaction and curiosity
- keep the destination flexible without reprinting the card

This is not a product, platform, or marketing page.
It is an experiment in simplicity, permanence, and change.

The page content may evolve.
The URL should remain stable.
